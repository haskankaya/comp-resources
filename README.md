# comp-resources
computational biology resources, also a public reading list for me

## basic programming / learning a new language
- [Codeacademy](www.codeacademy.com) - interactive web-hosted courses to familiarise you with fundamentals of a number of languages. Free versions are sufficient to get to know the ropes.

## scRNA-seq
See https://github.com/haskankaya/scrnaseq-resources.

## Git
- [Ponderomatics Introduction to Git for Bioinformaticians](http://ponderomatics.nfshost.com/git.html) - basic introduction to Git specialised towards bioinformaticians from Jakob Willforss
- [*Git from the bottom up](jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up)  - a complete guide on Git from John Wiegley


## Dimensionality Reduction
### PCA
- [*How to read PCA plots](http://www.nxn.se/valent/2017/6/12/how-to-read-pca-plots) - examples of how structures in PCA plots arise from scRNA-seq data with simulations to demonstrate from Valentine Svensson



## Misc
- [*Coppola Lab Bioinformatician's Trello Guide, lots of various reading sources to look at](https://trello.com/b/3geUNeW5/bioinformatics-training-resources-coppola-lab) - Trello board compiled by Coppola Lab with a bunch of interesting links to investigate
